PLEASE READ....

The boids.java and MyLWPService.java are from Google ^^

The app does allow you to choose the background image and object (just that there is only one object)
and create a live wallpaper with the two.

1) The boids.java i think... divides the object image into six or seven pieces and idk where that's written :3
2) When the created wallpaper is actually set as background, the app will crash / the background will appear black.

idk why :D
